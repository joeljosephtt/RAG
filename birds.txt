FOREWORD
Birds are important natural resources that contribute to ecology and ecological services with colours and
beauty. Their life cycle in varied habitats inform of healthy ecosystems and of recreational aspects of humanity.
Birds thrive and utilize number of habitat types during their life cycles. Migratory birds further depend on
number of sites and habitats along the migratory routes. The networks of these habitats form ecological
network, which have been playing decisive role in life of birds and biodiversity.
Bird watching is, in itself, a fast-growing recreational pursuit worldwide. Part of the activity's appeal is no
doubt its accessibility to the average person, who can find and observe birds almost anywhere on the planet.
The material in the publication compiled by Ms K M Abharna and Shri Mundhe Aravind Dattu during
their Indian Forest Service Probation and tours at the Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy is based on the
author's experience of bird watching and their own as well as colleague's photography in visited parts of
country. The content would be equally applicable for beginners for bird watching and on bird life elsewhere.
The practitioner and user of this book is suggested to maintain at least a note book, which can be valuable for
keeping one's own notes on observation made, for location and behavioural activities, associated information.
This becomes reference material as memory sometimes does not retrieve all at a later time. Elaborate noting as
record would help further when referred to books and guides. Additionally, a pair of binoculars would add to
better observations from a distance. The practical identification descriptions in simple and flowing manner
would enable beginner's especially new Probationers at IGNFA in coming years for their interest and
appreciation on local bird life of visited habitats into improved conservation and further efforts towards
livelihood and eco-tourism. The guiding description with excellent photographs and illustrations would be of
lot of interest and motivation for identification. The authors deserve rich compliments for their endeavours for
this work at IGNFA.
I am hopeful that the efforts of Ms K M Abharna and Shri Mundhe Aravind Dattu, IFS Probationers at
IGNFA during 2013-15 Training Course with visual depictions of listed birds would encourage bird lovers and
having liking for photography would benefit from their visits to attractive and unique locations during trainings
at IGNFA.

Tour Guide on Avifauna IGNFA
INTRODUCTION
Birding or Bird Watching is not only the hobby for the Indian Forest Service officers but also
it helps us to understand how the avifaunal life is related to the eco-system. To understand
the functions of avifauna in the ecosystem we shall know the types of birds and it's niche in
the ecosystem. This guide is the compilation of common birds which we found during our
different tours. Since, many of us are new to this profession this would be an easy guide to
identify the common birds when they are on tour. This will be much helpful for the
beginners who want to be a bird watcher.
We had five major tours covering all the major parts of India. The tours are split into Hill
tour, West India tour, South India tour, East India tour, and central India tour. In addition to
this we also had Wildlife Technique tour. There we had an opportunity to have enough
time to observe the avifauna population.
This guide is also divided into Hill tour, West India tour, South India tour, East India tour,
Central India tour and the common birds of that particular region has been described in the
simple language. During tours, the safaris, treks, morning walk into the jungle will help to
learn about more birds of different regions.
It's a small initiative for the easy understanding and the identification of various birds to the
beginners especially who are not from the science back ground.
